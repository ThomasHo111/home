				<span>Hello Everyone,</span>

				<p>
					One of my favourite hobbies is biking, The first time when I got into biking was when I was little. My first bike was the tri-cycle, I remember I used to ride this in the apartment and i would always do circles.
					After a year later I got my very own real bicycle and I loved it, everyday I would ask my parents if they could take me to the park to ride my bike. Every single day I would ask them the same question, they either got tired of me asking them or they just took me there. 
					In Gr 2, it was the first time I rode a bike without trainer wheels. 
					My Friends and Family went to camp at Algonquin Park, my friends asked me if I wanted to bike with them so I said, “Sure”. 
					When I saw they didn’t have trainer wheels I wanted to bike without them because I thought people who ride with no trainer wheels are cooler. 
					Instead of just leaving them on, I asked my dad if he can remove my trainer wheels and he did. So when I got on the bike I drove to the bathroom and back to the campsite without falling. I am still amazed how I could ride 
					withour trainer wheels in Algonquin Park where it is very bumpy. 
					Now I love biking because I love taking a walk through nature, the sense of the fresh air and getting to see many plants, flowers, and trees. Most of the time when we bike with our family friends we would go for 20km trails and it is lively.
