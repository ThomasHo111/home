					<span>Hello Everyone,</span> 
				</div>	
					<p>
						The first time I got into skiing is when I was 5 years old. My friends and family went skiing at Blue Mountain on the first day of skiing,  I had tutoring lessons and I learned the basics, 
						the techniques that I first learned are called pizza and french fries. I fell so many times while skiing but I loved the speed and adrenaline you get while skiing downhill. 
						The hills were so big and I wasnâ€™t scared for some reason. On that day I had so much fun skiing with my dad ands with my family friends. Now we always go skiing together at least once a year.   
						Back then I loved skiing because you can go very fast but now I appreciate nature I love looking at trees and when I went night skiing the sunset is so beautiful, one side is orange and the other side is black.
						Also, I enjoy going to the terrain park, the terrain park is where there are jumps, rails, and boxes. Last year I learned how to silde on a rail, I fell so many times but it was a fun experience.
