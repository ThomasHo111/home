				<h2>About Thomas Ho</h2>
				<br/>
				<!-- Sub-heading -->
				<span>Hello Everyone,</span> 
			</div>	
				<p>
					My name is Thomas Ho, I was born on November 9, 2006, in Toronto, Ontario. I have a mom, dad, and a dog named Shelby. My mom's name is Joanna and my dad's name is Jeffery I grew up in Scarborough and loved playing games and sports. 
					The first school that I ever went to was Emmanuel Pre-School, and after preschool I went to Whitefield and met so many friends and till this day they are still my best friends.
					They also love to game and play sports,  I would always play games after school ends and play till the night. I usually procrastinate and leave my projects at the end of the due date but it was fun. 
					My friends and I love to play sports, basktetball was one of them. Every lunch break we would go outside and scrimmage, it was so exciting and enjoyable. 
					I also started skiing at a very young age, at 6 years old I skiied on Mount St Louis, and that was my first time skiing, now it is one of my favourite hobbies but this year we couldn't go because of COVID-19.
					Furthermore, I love to bike, I started biking on a tri-cycle, and I fell in love with biking since. Whenever my friends came to my house we would bike for a very long time and have so much fun.
